#  Retail Theft Detection AI System

An end-to-end, cloud-enabled, AI-powered surveillance system for real-time retail theft detection.  
This project leverages YOLOv5 for object detection, AWS S3 for storage, and Streamlit for monitoring dashboards.

---

##  Project Overview

Traditional retail CCTV systems rely on human monitoring, making them prone to missed incidents. This project uses deep learning and cloud-native tools to automatically detect, annotate, and alert on suspicious activity across multiple store locations in real-time.

##  Core Features

-  Real-time person detection with YOLOv5  
-  S3-based storage and timestamped metadata  
-  Streamlit dashboard for reviewing detections  
-  Real-time alerts via AWS SNS or Firebase  
-  Modular and Docker-compatible design
